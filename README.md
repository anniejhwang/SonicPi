## Description
SonicPi is a code-based music creation and performance tool. My love for music, and addiction with OST's has influenced me to choose Sonic Pi as my independent interest project. Although I love music, I have trouble making original songs, so I've made a cover of a song that I like :)

## Basic Tutorial on Sonic Pi
- Sonic Pi uses data and programming structures such as loops, variables, conditionals, and threads. Therefore, it's important to be familiar with the fundamentals of Ruby. Musical structures that may benefit you are synthesizers, chords, melodies, and scales.
