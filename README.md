Hello everyone and welcome to my Sonic Pi song covers!

<a name="desc"></a>
## Description
In this project, I used Sonic Pi to recreate songs. SonicPi is a code-based music creation and performance tool. I used this software tool as an interest project during my coding bootcamp and found that it's a great way to learn about music composition and programming.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Sonic Pi installed on your computer. You can download it for free from the [Sonic-pi.net](https://sonic-pi.net/) website. 

Sonic Pi is available to you through Windows, macOS, or Raspberry Pi OS! More information regarding prerequisites can be discovered on their [GitHub](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi). 

Once you have Sonic Pi installed, you can now copy and paste the code into the Sonic Pi editor. Then it the "Run" button to hear the song!

## More Information on Sonic Pi
- Sonic Pi uses data and programming structures such as loops, variables, conditionals, and threads. Therefore, it's important to be familiar with the fundamentals of code. The specific language I used was Ruby. 
- Musical structures that may benefit you are synthesizers, chords, melodies, and scales. 
- You can find a more detailed tutorial on how Sonic Pi works [here](https://sonic-pi.net/tutorial.html#section-2)!
- Now you can experiment and create your own unique Sonic Pi song covers!
